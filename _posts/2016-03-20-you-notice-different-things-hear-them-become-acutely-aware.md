You notice different things, hear them, become acutely aware
of them (wind, road surface, bumps, traffic, the countryside). All of these
things can become small pleasures or challenges depending on the situation.

Perhaps the hardest thing has been the wind to cope with.
The Mistral is renowned and throughout the journey we witnessed the impact it
can have on your journey time, energy and mood. The first two days we had
30/40kmh headwinds and crosswinds while the second two days were tailwinds and
even no wind.

On average we found it makes a 5km per hour difference.
Clearly this doesn't sound like a lot until you realise that at 20kmh, we were
adding 60/90 minutes to our day for the first part as our speed dropped to
15kmh and then cruising on the homeward stretches, hitting speeds at times of
40kmh on the flat without any problem.
