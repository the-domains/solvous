**Day 1: St Pancras to
Avignon. No Gear and No Idea. **

This was where our adventure really began as by 5.30am on
Monday morning everything went tits up as we became cyclists heading out on a
cycling holiday with no cycles.

In one fell swoop we were standing at the Eurostar desk
facing the very real possibility of the trip ending before it began after being
told bikes weren't allowed on our train. It was at that moment that I recalled
when booking the tickets online months before, the small detail of bikes had
been decidedly vague.

However, I had trusted my previous great experience with
Eurostar of arriving at St Pancras, being directed to the Eurodespatch desk,
paying a small fee and the bikes being carefully taken from you and handed back
lovingly at the other end. What I hadn't realised was that this only happens
when you go to Paris.

It seems to actually leave London on a given day incurs a
kings ransom thinly disguised as tickets. Quickly weighing up our options, we
were faced with emptying our pockets to the tune of £450 for new Eurostar
tickets to Paris then hoping for the best for a TGV down to Avignon. The second
choice was to hand over around £400 to BA for flights (plus bike fee) that had
one change and eventually wound up in Marseille after 17 hours, then onwards to
Avignon. Our third option was to pay Eurostar's official courier £880 to get
the bikes shipped down there the next day or so. We also had the option of
turning around and going home defeated but not as violated.
